      <itunes:title>Race in L.A. – Raising A Black Boy In America When You’re Neither Black Nor American</itunes:title>
      <description>In this Saturday edition: Our story today is about a difficult conversation -- with a 6 year old. That 6 year old’s dad, Darren Fung, is Chinese Canadian. His wife, Gifty, is from Ghana. Their young son Andrew is biracial and Black.

And last summer, after protests broke out all over the country following the murder of George Floyd by police, something struck Darren and Gifty: Their son is going to grow up Black in America. How would they protect him? They found themselves at a loss. Especially one day during a drive to the beach, when then their son began asking questions that had no easy answers.
