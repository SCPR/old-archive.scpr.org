      <title>How savvy campaigns shape the Oscar race</title>
      <itunes:author>The Frame and Vulture</itunes:author>
      <itunes:summary>How do savvy Oscar campaign strategists like Harvey Weinstein shape narratives that propel one film to glory and leave another in the dust? Co-hosts John Horn (theframe.org)and Kyle Buchanan (vulture.com) make comparisons to the political messaging of Trump v. Hillary when parsing what works in Hollywood. They note how the campaign for "Manchester by the Sea" had to pivot from its original message and how "Lion" took advantage of real world events around Trump's travel ban in its Oscar campaign. Meanwhile, "Moonlight" has resisted the media's push to pit it against "La La Land," instead stressing the narratives of each creative person behind the film.
