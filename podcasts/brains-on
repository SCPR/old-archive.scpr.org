      <title>Million Bazillion answers your questions about money</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>Today we’re sharing an episode with you from our friends at Million Bazillion, the podcast that answers the questions kids have about money. They help dollars make more sense and they’re back for a whole new season! </p>
<p> In today’s episode, hosts Jed and Bridget answer a question from two curious listeners who want to know why we pay taxes. In answering the question, they come across the legendary Robin Hood, known for his hatred of taxes. Back in his day, tax-collecting sheriffs forced people to pay money to a king, who decided how those taxes were spent. These days our tax system works a bit differently. We get to vote for people who’ll spend that money on things we care about — like schools and libraries, health care for elderly people, police, parks, sewers and so on. With the help of a rambling troubadour and a tax policy expert, Jed and Bridget teach Robin Hood that the way tax dollars are spent today reflects what we prioritize as a society. Plus, we’ll ask random kids some not-so-random questions.</p>
<p>Million Bazillion is a collaboration between Brains On and Marketplace. It’s hosted by Jed Kim and Bridget Bodnar. You can listen to <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/million-bazillion/" title="https://www.marketplace.org/shows/million-bazillion/">more episodes here</a>, or subscribe at <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/million-bazillion/id1523486568">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/1QlbveZv5f9T0lo4qu8pkU?si=VtCWiw5TQmmkNDk1gIfFxQ">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubWFya2V0cGxhY2Uub3JnL2ZlZWQvcG9kY2FzdC9taWxsaW9uLWJhemlsbGlvbg?ved=2ahUKEwivsdW999LqAhWCnZ4KHX0RBi4Q4aUDegQIARAC&hl=en">Google Podcasts</a>, or wherever you get your podcasts.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we&#39;re tackling all the mosquito questions that have been bugging our listeners. Why do they bite? Why do the bites itch? Is scratching them a good idea? Why do some people seem to be more delicious to mosquitoes? How can we keep them away from us? And are mosquitoes good for the world? The Hoax Hunters make an appearance plus the Moment of Um answers the question, &quot;What is a solar flare?&quot;</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Adults around the world are getting vaccinated against the coronavirus, and now, in a handful of countries (including the U.S.) kids over 12 can get vaccinated too. </p>
<p>We hear from a 13-year-old who participated in a clinical trial for a vaccine and get tips for how to navigate the world when only some people in your family are able to be vaccinated. Plus, Kara and Gilly share expert advice on how to handle big feelings as the world starts to open back up. </p>
<p>And a new Moment of Um answers the question: What are eye boogers?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>We treat dogs like they&#39;re part of the family. But do they know they are a different species, or do they think they&#39;re just short, four-legged people?</p>
<p>In this episode, canine cognition researcher Alexandra Horowitz helps us puzzle out this question. We’ll also find out what happens (or doesn’t) when a dog looks in the mirror. Dogs are always dozing, and we’ll check in to see if they are dreaming too. And, we take a quick trip around the world in the language of barks. </p>
<p>All that, plus a brand new Mystery Sound and a Moment of Um that answers the question: “Why does the moon follow us?”</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>There’s no better way to celebrate our 200th episode than with our own shining star: the sun! In this episode we speak with Dr. Nicola Fox, who leads a team of NASA scientists that sent a probe to collect data and zoom by the sun. We also hear some great listener suggestions on what new planet could be added to our solar system. We even get a chance to check in with The Sun and her weekly broadcast, <em>That’s Hot</em>.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our 200th episode wouldn’t be complete without a visit from some of our favorite pals: Bob, Gungador, Harvey and Elevator! Of course there’s a new Mystery Sound too. And the Moment of Um comes just in time for mosquito season, because it answers the question: Why do we itch?</p>
<p></p>
<p>Thank you so much for helping us make 200 episodes! We could never have done it without your questions and encouragement, and we can’t wait to make 200 more!</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>We’ve all played the “what does that cloud look like” game. Maybe you saw a bunny… or an airplane… or a unicorn. What if that same cloud could also be seen by someone in a far off continent? That’s what a listener in Minnesota wondered. He wanted to know if the same cloud he saw in a park near his house could also be seen in Africa.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We talk to Deanna Hence, one of our favorite weather experts, and she tells us about how clouds travel. We also dust off the Zoom Ray to learn about what is inside of a cloud. And have you ever noticed the similarities between cloud types, like cumulonimbus, and magic spells from <em>Harry Potter</em>? Well, we have, and we made a game out of it!</p>
<p></p>
<p>We also have a brand new Mystery Sound for your guessing pleasure and a Moment of Um that answers the question: Why do pugs have such scrunchy faces?  </p>

In this episode, Sloth Appreciation Society founder Lucy Cooke stops by to tell us all about these amazing animals. We also get into a sloth mystery: The Case of the Perilous Poop Journey. Luckily, there’s a sloth sleuth on the case. And sloths aren’t the only animals who aren’t in a hurry — a few others show off their slowest skills.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There’s also a Mystery Sound for you to guess, and a Moment of Um: Why do ostriches stick their heads in the ground?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>If you translate “Hello! How are you?” to binary code, it looks like this: 01001000 01100101 01101100 01101100 01101111 00100001 00100000 01001000 01101111 01110111 00100000 01100001 01110010 01100101 00100000 01111001 01101111 01110101 00111111 </p>
<p></p>
<p>This episode takes a look at how computers can do so much with such tiny parts. But computers weren&#39;t always small -- so we take a look at where computers came from. We visit Ada Lovelace, whose love of math and weaving paved the way for modern-day computers. And we hear about the material that let computers shrink from the size of a room to something that fits in our pockets. There’s also a visit from a yak and a ram, but you’re just going to have to listen to find out why.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All that plus a new Mystery Sound and Moment of Um that answers the question: what is the flavor of root beer?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Will we ever get to rewind time, or fast forward through it? Sanden stops by to tell us all about how time works. He also has a couple ideas about how we might make time travel a reality! But one tricky thing about time travel is that it’s full of paradoxes — so we look into those, too. And science fiction expert Lisa Yaszek swings by to tell us just how long humans have been thinking about time travel (hint: a really long time).</p>
<p></p>
<p>Listen closely for the mystery sound, and the moment of um: how do clothes get dirty even though you can’t see it?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Screens are everywhere these days! We’re taking a look at why smartphones are so addictive, and how our devices affect us. Our co-hosts took on a bold challenge for this episode: they went a week without phones or tablets. We’ll hear how their experiment went, then Sanden will fill us in on the brain chemical that trains us to love our screens. We&#39;ll also learn why the predictability of messages and alerts on smartphones makes them extra hard to put down. Plus, we’ll get a few tips from Catherine Price, the author of How to Break Up With Your Phone. And! A our Moment of Um answers: why are bruises blue, and how do we get them? <br><br>This episode is sponsored by Wondery’s Little Stories Everywhere (<a href="https://wondery.com/shows/little-stories-everywhere/" title="https://wondery.com/shows/little-stories-everywhere/">https://wondery.com/shows/little-stories-everywhere/</a>) and the FDA (fda.gov/FeedYourMind).</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>20 years ago, we pictured dinosaurs as green, scaly animals. But times have changed! Now, we know some dinosaurs had feathers. And who knows — maybe some even had stripes.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This episode looks at how we figure out what color dinosaurs might’ve been. We talk to Jingmai O’Connor, who studies fossil reptiles, about finding color pigment in fossils. And paleoartist Emily Willoughby talks to a “museum” about how her dino-depictions have changed over the years. </p>
<p></p>
<p>Our co-host, Elyana, also brought us this important question: If dinosaurs evolved from birds and birds don’t fart, did dinosaurs fart? Wha-wha-what!?! Look no further than this episode for an extensive investigation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Remember to keep your ears open for the brand new Mystery Sound. And break out your kilns, because today’s Moment of Um answers this question: How do you make clay for pottery?</p>
<p></p>
<p>There’s so much dino-tastic information that we decided to make a second dinosaur episode. So if you haven’t had enough (and who has?), make sure to check out next week’s show about what dinosaurs might have sounded like.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>In this encore episode, we answer the questions: How does the moon control the tides? Where do waves come from? And what’s it like to live in a tide pool?<br><br>Sir Isaac Newton drops by and drops some knowledge. He helps explain why the tides ebb and flow. Then, an oceanographer/surfer tells us where waves come from and how they get their shape – cowabunga! Plus we hear about what it’s like for marine life that move to a new neighborhood once or twice a day. Sometimes it’s underwater, sometimes it’s not. Plus a brand new Moment of Um answers the question: Why don’t our ears have bones? And there’s a new group of listeners to be added to the Brains Honor Roll.</p>

Plus, how do you navigate all the tricky parts of crushes -- like your crush finding out you like them?</p>
<p></p>
<p>We tackle all these questions. Stick around for a Moment of Um that answers: &quot;What would happened if it rained oobleck?&quot;</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>HARVEY, our omnipresent virtual voice assistant, gets a software update that makes him go bananas for bananas. And if we talk about anything except bananas, he turns the microphones off! We talk to geneticist Dr. Janina Jeff about how much DNA we share with a banana, find out why bananas make other fruits ripen, how bananas grow, and where that slipping on a banana peel joke came from. Speaking of jokes, we&#39;ll hear a bunch of banana jokes from listeners too! Plus: The Moment of Um answers the question: &quot;Why are peaches fuzzy?&quot;</p>
<p>You can hear more from Dr. Jeff on her podcast <a href="https://inthosegenes.com/">In Those Genes</a>.</p>
<p>Silent film expert Lea Stans has a wonderful blog post about the history of the banana peel joke <a href="https://silentology.wordpress.com/2015/04/01/the-history-of-those-darn-banana-peels/">that you can read right here</a>. You can see some of those early comics that featured the joke! </p>

So how did scientists develop these vaccines so fast? And how did they test the vaccines to make sure they’re safe? And how do these mRNA vaccines work?</p>
<p></p>
<p>We have answers to all your questions, plus New York Times science journalist Apoorva Mandavilli explains what scientists have found out about how long immunity lasts to this new coronavirus. And Kara and Gilly are back with a cow-side chat about herd immunity.

        <![CDATA[<p>Today we have a special episode featuring an old friend of ours -- scientist and inventor Gitanjali Rao. Time Magazine recently named her the first-ever <a href="https://time.com/5916772/kid-of-the-year-2020/" class="default">Kid of the Year</a>! </p>
<p>We first met Gitanjali back in 2018, when she was the co-host for a series of episodes we did all about water. Back then, she was a 12 year old who had recently won 2017 Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge. </p>
<p>Now, she&#39;s a very busy 15 year-old who is an inventor, STEM advocate and author. Molly and Gitanjali chat about how kids can turn their ideas into reality, and why kids shouldn&#39;t be afraid to share their viewpoints and skills with the world -- we need them!</p>
<p>Gitanjali has also written a book, <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/A-Young-Innovators-Guide-to-STEM/Gitanjali-Rao/9781642938005" class="default">which you can check out here</a>.</p>
<p>Also, you can hear Gitanjali judge a very science-y Smash Boom Debate:<strong> </strong><strong><a href="https://www.smashboom.org/episode/2021/01/14/helium-vs-neon" class="default">Helium vs Neon</a></strong><strong>!</strong></p>
<p>Check out the water series that Gitanjali co-hosted:</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Synthesizers are a very recent invention, especially when you compare them to acoustic instruments, like pianos and guitars. In this episode, we learn how these machines with keys, knobs, switches, buttons and sliders actually make sound. We’ll also travel back to the 1960’s and hear how synth pioneers like Bob Moog helped bring these sound making devices into the mainstream. Plus, we’ll check in with Suzanne Ciani, who has been using her synthesizer to create iconic sounds for movies, television and video games for over 50 years! All that plus a striking Mystery Sound and Moment of Um that answers the question: Do airplanes have a speed limit?</p>
<p>Want to take a deeper dive into the world of synthesizers? Check out Francis Preve’s digital book, <strong><a href="https://books.apple.com/be/book/audiokit-synth-one-the-ultimate-guide/id1544368523" class="default">AudioKit Synth One: The Ultimate Guid‪e‬</a></strong>. It’s free!</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Having a sibling is a special thing -- but, wow, can they be annoying! In this episode we’ll look at why our brothers and sisters are so good at pushing our buttons. Plus, is there any truth to the idea that oldest kids are the most mature and the youngest ones are the most charming? We’ll look at the science of personality and birth order. We also visit a sibling drive-thru, get quizzed about animal relationships and answer this question in our Moment of Um: why does rain come in small droplets?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>The flu shot changes every year. But why is the flu special, if other illnesses have much longer-lasting vaccines? This episode takes us into the world of viruses and immunity.<br><br>We released this episode about flu vaccines last year but we wanted to share it with you again since it’s flu vaccine season but also because vaccines are in the news a lot lately. Scientists are testing a bunch of vaccines for the new coronavirus right now. This episode gets into the details of how vaccines work and how they’re made.<br><br>A friendly lymphocyte fills us in on how flu shots work, and science journalist Anna Rothschild shares how vaccines started around the world. We&#39;ll hear from some virus-busting detectives to see how scientists solve the case of how to make next year’s flu shot as effective as possible. Author Maryn McKenna will stop by and drop some flu knowledge, too!</p>
<p>Get your ears ready for a good, thumping mystery sound, and a new Moment of Um: how do straws work?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>How are mountains made? What causes an earthquake? How does hot lava come bubbling up? The answer in each case is…tectonic plates!</p>
<p>These are giant, moving slabs of rock covering the Earth’s surface. When they slide past or smash into each other it shakes the planet. But, they also helped shape the land we live on.</p>
<p>Find out how they work with an extreme cooking demonstration (you’ll never see peanut M&amp;Ms the same way). Meet the scientist who thought long ago all the continents were smushed together in a super-continent (spoiler: he was right!). Plus an interview with a USGS scientist about what our planet might look like in a million years.</p>
<p>All that plus a mystery sound and a Moment of Um about stinky breath. Listen up and rock on!</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>A listener asked how making  Brains On is different during the pandemic. So with this episode we&#39;re giving you a peek into how we&#39;re making the show while staying safe. Spoiler alert: we&#39;re doing it all from our homes! </p>
<p></p>
<p>What&#39;s the best way to record crystal clear sound at home? (Hint: Lots of soft surfaces!) How do we make sound effects? How do we get all the animals, humans and machines in our homes to keep it down while we tape? Plus: We asked our co-hosts to share what it was like for them to record and episode from home. All that, plus a brand new mystery sound and a Moment of Um that answers the question: how do rocks form?</p>

In this episode, Mars interviews the biggest star in his eyes: the sun! We also ask astronomer Moiya McTier to help us count all the stars in the universe. And we&#39;ll hear a couple of the stories that people here on earth tell about the stars. Plus, a brand new mystery sound and a Moment of Um that answers the question: how do whales drink?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Since the world first learned about this new coronavirus at the end of 2019, we’ve been watching science happen in real time. Scientists all over the world are studying this virus and learning how to protect us from it. As they learn new things, we learn new things too.</p>
<p><br>One thing they’ve learned is how this virus spreads. The primary culprit is droplets from our noses and mouths. That’s why masking up is so important to protect our communities.</p>
<p><br>We’ve also been hearing from a lot of listeners wanting to know about the future: when will the vaccine be ready? what will it be like at school? when will things go back to normal? We&#39;re going to do our best to answer some of these questions in our next coronavirus episode. But they don’t have concrete answers right now.</p>
<p><br>Right now, trying to look a month, or a year into the future is hard. We call this feeling of not knowing what will happen -- uncertainty. And it’s hard to deal with.</p>
<p><br>Our brains likes being able to predict what’s going to happen because it makes us feel safe. When we feel unsafe, that’s when anxiety kicks in. </p>
<p><br>One way to deal with this anxiety is to focus on the present -- what’s happening right now. </p>
<p></p>
<p>It’s also important to let yourself feel your feelings and know you’re not alone in them. It’s normal right now to feel frustrated, or angry, or sad, or all of them at the same time. But also try to think about the moments you have that are fun, and the times you feel contentment and happiness.</p>
<p></p>
<p>If you’re having trouble staying focused on the present there are some tricks you can try:</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Look around you and make a list in your head of everything you see that is green.</p></li>
<li><p>Try to think of all the character’s names in your favorite book or tv show</p></li>
<li><p>Take deep breaths -- inhale for four counts, hold that breath for four, and then exhale for four</p></li>
<li><p>Distract yourself by going outside, or watching a movie or reading a book. </p></li>

</ul>

<p></p>
<p>If you’re still having trouble keeping your mind off the “what ifs” it’s great to talk to your parents or another adult you trust.</p>
<p></p>
<p>There are always people who want to help you. If you need help and aren’t sure who to talk to, you can call 800 273-8255. It&#39;s a free phone call, and people are there all the time, ready to listen and help.</p>
<p>MORE: <a href="https://childmind.org/coping-during-covid-19-resources-for-parents/">The Child Mind Institute has a lot of resources </a>for families about how to deal with this uncertain time. (https://childmind.org/coping-during-covid-19-resources-for-parents/)</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>We’re talking all about teeny, tiny robots in today’s episode. You know, the ones that are as light as a postage stamp and as look like insects? They may be small, but these robots can still take in information and make decisions on their own. Find out how bees and cockroaches are teaching us about the future of small robots and what <em>big</em> tasks they might take on. There’s also a new Mystery Sound to rattle your ears. Plus a moment of Um that answers the question: Why does the sun stay in one place?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>We’re taking on an age-old question today: Do kids have more energy than adults? Breakfast tacos, caffeine, an energized DJ and an epic battle between a girl and her parents. This episode has all that and then some. Discover how we turn food into energy at an awesome taco party. Then pump up the jams with DJ Thyroid. Speaking of music, get ready for a song from Lake Street Dive’s Mike Olson. And just when you think the show might be out of energy, we engage in an out-of breath competition between a kid and her parents. Plus, there’s a brand new Mystery Sound and a Moment of Um about why we lose our voices sometimes.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>A lot of us are angry right now, with good reason. We’re seeing people treated unfairly because of racism -- that’s when people don’t like someone’s race or the color of their skin.<br><br>In this episode we’ll talk about how anger can be a useful emotion and can be used to push for change. We’ll also revisit parts of our 2019 series on emotions, including an explanation of the hormones behind anger, why some of us are quicker to anger than others and what we can do when we feel overwhelmed by our feelings. <br><br>Plus, our Moment of Um tackles the question, “What happens when lightning strikes water?”</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>There’s more to plants than meets the eye. They detect sounds, they defend themselves against insect attacks and they can even send each other secret messages through the wind! Our leafy, green friends sense and interact with the world in their own, planty way. We’ll learn all about it in this episode, plus we’ll find out why some plants like to grow in spots where other plants have died. We’ve also got a Mystery Sound and a Moment of Um that answers the question: why do bats sleep upside down?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p><em>This is a special re-release of an episode from our series on emotions. It’s all about how to handle big feelings like anxiety, nervousness and fear.</em></p>
<p><em>There have been so many unexpected changes in all of our lives and a lot of us have big feelings right now. And that’s good -- we should feel those feelings. We also think having facts and information can help you feel more in control. This episode should help you with that.</em></p>
<p>(This is the final installment in our series about feelings. Check out the first three if you haven&#39;t yet.) You know that feeling when you have butterflies in your stomach? Or maybe you get sweaty and hot? Or maybe you get fidgety and your heart beats really fast? Yeah, we know those feelings too. Today we&#39;re finding out why being anxious can make our bodies feel that way. We&#39;ll find out why fear has been really useful to our survival as a species and what you can do if that fear and anxiety is too much to handle. Plus: Mallika Chopra, the author of Just Breathe, shares a meditation to try when you&#39;re feeling nervous. And we&#39;ll finally get to hear Sanden&#39;s debut in the new Alpaca Jack musical, Fleece of Mind!</p>

<p>In this episode, we learn all about narwhals (what that tusk is for and how they’re connected to the myth of the unicorn) and the evolution of teeth (from scale-like nubbins to the versatile chompers we have today).</p>
<p>Plus our Moment of Um explores whether or not water has a taste.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Have you ever entered the mirror-verse and heard yourself talking back? Well, that’s what happens in today’s episode. </p>
<p>We take a look (pun intended) at how mirrors work and talk to a scientist to find out what color they are. And in a history of sequins, we learn why, for a long time, rain was a disaster for glittery gowns. Not only can you make today’s Mystery Sound, but you can use it to spiff up your crafts. </p>
<p>All that, plus a Moment of Um about why words start sounding funny funny funny funny funny when you repeat them.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>You might think flavor is what happens on your tongue – and it is. But it’s also so much more. </p>
<p>Flavor is influenced by all the senses. How food looks, smells and feels can make a difference. Even the sounds you hear while eating can impact how you perceive taste. </p>
<p>We’ll visit a tastebud beauty salon, talk with a chef researcher and do some experiments provided by our friends at America’s Test Kitchen Kids. Plus: a three-part Mystery Sound and a Moment of Um that answers the question: “What makes spicy food spicy?”</p>
<p>Note: If you want to do the experiments along with us, congratulations, you can! You’ll need jellybeans, a blindfold and two pieces of dark chocolate. Listen, eat and yum!</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>What was the first lifeform like? What was the first fish or mammal? Is it even possible to know? In this episode, we look to the fossil record to help us trace our roots back to the Last Universal Common Ancestor. Paleontologist Neil Shubin joins us to talk about discovering a remarkably cool fossil that helped us understand how life evolved over billions of years. We also take a field trip to the Hall of Ancestors and examine a few branches on the tree of life. And we learn why figuring out how life began on earth could help us as we find life elsewhere in the universe.</p>

The internet can seem vast and intangible but there’s a very physical system of cables, servers and exchange points across the globe (and yes, even under the oceans). We’ll find out how a video shows up nearly instantly on our screens and about insanely thin, clear glass tubes are the key to our digital communication.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Most of us think we’re good at detecting lies, but it turns out humans only get it right about half the time. And why do we do it anyway? What makes us want to deceive other people? In this episode we get to the truth about lying. We take a look at when people start lying, and how that helps us in our development as humans. We also hear from A. Lie, who tries to remind us that we might need lies more than we think. Plus, Angela Evans stops by and fills us in on the latest lie detection research. And remember to listen for the Moment of Um at the end of the show. This time we get squishy and find out if sponges are still harvested from the sea.

        <![CDATA[<p>Have you heard the word dyslexia before? It&#39;s a term used to describe when people have a hard time learning to read. It&#39;s actually very common because reading is a fairly new skill that humans have developed.</p>
<p>In this episode we do a deep dive on dyslexia. We&#39;ll look at how our brains have cobbled together the ability to read by re-purposing parts of the brain that evolved for other functions. And we’ll learn what scientists think might be going on in the brains of people with dyslexia when they learn to read. We also talk to Ann Bancroft, a Polar explorer and educator who also has dyslexia, about why getting lost can be fun.</p>
<p>Plus we’ll hear a new Mystery Sound and find out if mice actually do love cheese in our Moment of Um.</p>

<p>In this episode we explain how elevators work and we talk about how they’ve changed over time. For instance, did you know the first elevators had no walls?</p>
<p>We also speak with historian Lee Gray about two elevator innovators who both happen to be named Otis. Speaking of Otis, Vijay Jayachandran with the Otis Elevator company, joins us to drop some high level elevator facts. Plus, we hear your ideas for the elevators of the future! And listen to the end to our Moment of Um for an answer to this question: Why do crickets chirp?<br><br>This episode is sponsored by Old El Paso, Sun Basket (sunbasket.com/brains), Panama City Beach (VisitPanamaCityBeach.com) and The Great Courses Plus (thegreatcoursesplus.com/brainson).

        <![CDATA[<p>Human-made plastics are super useful -- they&#39;re lightweight, can be molded into anything, and they don’t break down. And because plastic is so versatile, we humans have found lots of uses for it. But the fact that it last forever means we find ourselves with a plastic problem. In this episode, we&#39;ll learn about the invention of plastic, how it&#39;s made and recycled and what you can do to help handle plastic waste. Plus: A very special appearance by Gungador, a tricky mystery sound and a Moment of Um that answers the question: &quot;How do glow in the dark things glow?&quot;</p>
<p>One thing you can do now to help with plastic pollution is use Jenna Jambeck&#39;s <a href="https://marinedebris.engr.uga.edu/" title="Marine Debris Tracker">Marine Debris Tracker</a> to report where you&#39;re finding plastic in the environment.</p>

Our listeners have a lot of questions about the way animals see the world, and this episode tackles lots of them. We&#39;ll visit a lab where scientists are observing predatory insects to find out how their brains work, we&#39;ll drop in on the Eyes Open Wider support group for animals, and give you a catchy melody that will help you remember the electromagnetic spectrum -- that&#39;s all the light that&#39;s both visible and invisible to us. And our Moment of Um answers the question: Why are we lighter in a pool of water?</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>This is the second episode in our four-part series on feelings! In this episode, we&#39;re covering the small and big parts of sadness.</p>
<p>Because this episode touches on some heavy pieces of sadness -- we recommend kids listening along with an adult, so you can talk over any questions that come up. But this episode has plenty of fun stuff, too!</p>
<p>We&#39;ll learn about how social animals -- from goldfish and penguins, to humans -- all seem to get sad sometimes. We&#39;ll talk about some ways to help handle sad feelings (doctor-approved pet cuddles, anyone?). And Neptune and Pluto will join us to cover a few ways to help friends or family members who are feeling blue.</p>
<p>Mallika Chopra will also share a meditation to help with sad feelings. In fact, she leads meditations in each episode of this series. For more, <a href="http://https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/mallika-chopra/just-breathe/9780762491582/">you can check out Mallika Chopra&#39;s book for kids, Just Breathe</a>.</p>
<p>Another note about sadness: everybody feels sad sometimes, and that&#39;s totally normal. It can help to talk about your sadness with someone, like a friend or parent. But sometimes sadness can feel overwhelming. If you don&#39;t feel like you have anybody to talk to and feel unsafe, there are people ready to listen. Call 800 273-8255. It&#39;s a free phone call, and people are there all the time, ready to listen and help.</p>
<p>This series is a collaboration with <a href="http://https://www.calltomindnow.org/">Call to Mind</a>, American Public Media&#39;s mental health initiative.</p>

We&#39;ll get a play-by-play of the chemicals in our brain that trigger joyful feelings, and use the zoom ray to see what good vibes do for our bodies. We&#39;ll also hear about how each of us have different emotional thermostats and why thinking about our feelings can help us figure out what to do with them. </p>

        <![CDATA[<p>The hair on our heads is on our minds. We have fun with follicles and learn about how they make hair. Our experts help us decipher what makes hair black or brown, blonde or red, and even why it turns gray. From eye lashes to ear and nose hair, this episode has it all. Why do humans have hair and not fur? Why is there hair on the top of our heads? How does hair grow? How does hair become curly or straight? Plus: A brand new Moment of Um answers the question: &quot;Why does my dad get fuzz in his belly button?&quot; This episode is sponsored by Philo (philo.tv/brains), New Cloud Control Cat Litter by Arm &amp; Hammer, Bona Premium Spray Mop (bona.com/brainson) and Goodnight Stories for Rebel Girls the Podcast (rebelgirls.co/podcast).

        <![CDATA[<p>Most plants get the energy and nutrients they need from water, sunlight, air and soil. But carnivorous plants get key nutrients from a different source: bugs. We’ll find out how they do it and talk about the mystery of how venus fly traps snap shut. Plus: Two gardeners – one very experienced and one just starting out – offer their tips for growing venus fly traps.</p>
<p>So that’s plants, but what about animals? Carnivores are animals that only eat other animals – so how do they get the vitamins, minerals and fiber that we humans get from eating plants? We take a trip to a salad bar with some animal pals to find out.

        <![CDATA[<p>In this episode, we take a trip down memory lane. We visit a campus full of hippos to learn how memories are stored, and drop in on a badger trainer to see how she recalls “the great badger blunder.” We also explore how many memories can our brains store. Hint: way more than you probably think. You may have heard of deja vu, but did you know there are other vus too? We found a lost game show where these vus are contestants. All this plus a new Mystery Sound and Moment of Um that answers the question: do fish have allergies? Tune in to find out!</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>From ice cubes to ice cream, cold things are a crucial part of cuisine. How do we use chill to our advantage? This is part two of our series on the science of cooking, a collaboration with the brilliant foodies at America&#39;s Test Kitchen Kids. This episode is (literally) super cool. We&#39;re figuring out how refrigerators work and why some of their parts are hot. We&#39;re traveling back in time to find out how selling ice became a very big business (for a while anyway). And we&#39;ll learn why ice cream makes people thirsty and how to make incredibly delicious paletas. Plus: Our Moment of Um tackles the question, &quot;Why do mints make your mouth feel cold?&quot;  For more recipes and information for young chefs, head to americastestkitchen.com/kids to sign up for their newsletter.

        <![CDATA[<p>We’ve teamed up with America’s Test Kitchen Kids to delve into the scrumptious science of cooking. You’ve sent in so many great cooking questions that we had to spread the answers over four episodes. This is our first installment: HEAT. What crazy chemical reactions does heat trigger in food? How do microwave ovens work -- and why can’t you put metal in them when they’re lined with metal? We’ll answer those questions, find out how feeding squirrels helped profoundly change how we prepare food and learn the recipe for a perfect grilled cheese sandwich. Plus: our Moment of Um tackles the question, “How does coffee keep you awake?”</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>One of the weirdest substances in the universe is right under your nose. No, not boogers. Water! Water seems ordinary, almost boring, but take a closer look and you’ll find a wonderfully weird molecule that behaves like nothing else in the universe. It can move up against gravity. It can absorb lots of heat energy without getting super hot. It can dissolve almost anything. It carves canyons and quenches our thirst. Why is water so weird, and why does that matter?

It’s a new show called Smash Boom Best and it’s nothing but debates. Sort of like the ones you’ve heard on Brains On, but with a few new twists. It’s a little faster paced, a little sillier and we hope you’ll think it’s a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Today: Wings out, eyes wide -- we’re swooping in on a battle between a perfect pair of creatures of the night. Which is cooler: Bats? Or owls? We’re going to hear lots of facts and feelings from our debaters: Brandi Brown and Katie McVay. Who will be chosen the Smash Boom Best? Listen to hear what our judge decides and then head over to smashboom.org to share your opinion with us! And subscribe to Smash Boom Best wherever you get your podcasts to hear the rest of this season&#39;s debates.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>What’s in your water, and how did it get there? Clean water is a must, but modern living can put a lot of bad stuff in it. Road salt, fertilizer, dog doo-doo, heavy metals - how do these things get in our water? Why should we care? And how can we tell if our water is healthy? In this episode we hitch a ride on the water cycle with a pair of water drops. We learn about what caused the Flint water crisis. And we hear about one young girl’s award-winning idea for a faster way to test lead in water - spoiler alert - it involves carbon nanotubes! This is the first in a series of water-related episodes we’re working on over the next few months. We hope it makes a splash with you!</p>

We’ll also look at all the important things our bodies do with water — and how that’s a cycle too. Caution: this episode may make you very thirsty.</p>
