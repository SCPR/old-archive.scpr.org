What cultural baggage do we bring to sex and relationships? Why is Korean skincare so popular? When does something get upgraded from the ethnic aisle? Amy and Rebecca, first-generation Americans themselves, talk to Mash-Up luminaries such as Randall Park and Maz Jobrani, as well as experts, listeners, and up-and-comers, to dive into all of the complexity we face as people who straddle multiple cultures and identities. </p><p>Get more at http://mashupamericans.com and on Facebook and Twitter.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Aline Brosh McKenna is a Hollywood triple threat; she’s a showrunner, director, and writer and she does them all really really well. She has worked in this business for more than two decades but her mission has remained the same: to center women’s stories around something other than a man. We talk about Cher, body hair, bacterial vaginosis, and so much more. Get ready!</p><p>She’s the writer of your favorite rom coms, from <em>27 Dresses</em> to <em>The Devil Wears Prada</em> to <em>I Don’t Know How She Does It</em>. Most recently she has been busy showrunning and writing <em>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend</em> which is now in its fourth and final season. </p><p>Aline tells us what it was like growing up in the 70’s in very white suburban New Jersey with Jewish immigrant parents, and why she relates more to people with immigrant parents than other Jewish people. She tells us about the differences between being a boss in her 20’s and being a boss in her 40’s, and why she wants to write more roles for women over 50. </p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href="https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>]]>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>It's that time of year. Time for New Year's resolutions (or not), forgiveness, and moving ahead. 2017 has been a reckoning for all of us — an examination of who and what we fight for, and why. We've looked deeply at ourselves and sat in the uncomfortable acknowledgement that maybe we could have done more. And as we push the world to change, to do better and be better, we're also pushing ourselves. But what's the best way to do that? Joining Amy and Rebecca on the podcast today is Kristen Meinzer, host of the podcast By The Book. She's a rad woman, a Korean-American Mash-Up, and an advice and self-help expert. She helps us tackle New Year's resolutions and how best to make space for change in our own lives.

      <title>Replay: Krista Tippett On Why The Wisest People Are Always Smiling</title>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[Sometimes when this earthly world gets us down, it’s good to remember that there is more than our everyday grind — or our everyday bananas Senate hearing, as it were. Krista Tippett, creator of On Being and convener of the American conversation on spirituality, sits down with Amy and Rebecca to dig into the Big Questions: How does religion connect the soul to the body? What does it mean to live a spiritual life? How do our roots inform our future growth? Also, what does it mean for your identity when your curly hair turns straight? (Seriously.) For more on Krista and her spiritual practice, check out mashupamericans.com.
