      <title>State Politics, Secretary Of State Confirms Gubernatorial Recall Election, Plus A New Report Says Newsom Over Promised On Wildfire Prevention</title>
      <itunes:title>State Politics, Secretary Of State Confirms Gubernatorial Recall Election, Plus A New Report Says Newsom Over Promised On Wildfire Prevention</itunes:title>
      <description>California Gov. Gavin Newsom has vastly overstated wildfire prevention work completed by his administration, according to a Capital Public Radio investigation released Wednesday.

State fire officials have treated less than 18 of the 140 square miles (50 of the 365 square kilometers) that the Democratic governor has touted, the radio station reported. The land is part of 35 priority projects Newsom designated in 2019 on the heels of the deadliest wildfire season in state history. In 2020, California's fuel reduction efforts also dropped from the year before, and Newsom cut the fire prevention budget by $150 million, CapRadio reported.  The governor's office declined to comment on the investigation, and state fire officials took responsibility for Newsom sharing inaccurate information. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection had not “done our job in educating the public, nor the governor's office” on how to communicate about the efforts, Chief Tom Porter said. Republican lawmakers and those challenging Newsom in an expected recall election later this year quickly jumped on the story as evidence of mismanagement and deceptive governing.

Also on Wednesday, the recall election for Governor Newsom took another step forward as the Secretary of State’s office said that counties had submitted final signature counts following the period provided by state law that allows people who have signed the recall petition to withdraw their signatures. The final tally was more than 200,000 signatures over what’s required to trigger the recall. As POLITICO’s Jeremy B. White reports, this was an incremental step, as the governor’s office has already said it knows the signatures withdrawn in that window wouldn’t be enough to cancel the recall.

Today on AirTalk, we’ll look at the latest on the recall election and dig into the findings of the CapRadio investigation on state efforts to prevent wildfires.

      <title>SCOTUS Rulings Student’s Freedom Of Speech, Union Access To CA Farmworkers And Police Home Entry</title>
      <itunes:title>SCOTUS Rulings Student’s Freedom Of Speech, Union Access To CA Farmworkers And Police Home Entry</itunes:title>
      <description>The Supreme Court ruled this week that a Pennsylvania public school wrongly suspended a student from cheerleading over a vulgar social media post she made after she didn’t qualify for the varsity team.

The court voted 8-1 in favor of Brandi Levy, who was a 14-year-old high school freshman when she expressed her disappointment over not making the varsity cheerleading squad with a string of curse words and a raised middle finger on Snapchat.

The Supreme Court also sided with California agriculture businesses in their challenge to a state regulation that gives unions access to farm property in order to organize workers. As a result of the ruling, California will have to modify or abandon the regulation put in place in 1975 after the efforts of labor leader Cesar Chavez. The justices ruled 6-3 along ideological lines for the agriculture businesses. It’s another potential setback for unions as a result of a high court decision.

“The access regulation amounts to simple appropriation of private property,” Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the conservative members of the court.

At issue was a regulation that granted unions access to farms and other agriculture businesses for up to three hours per day, 120 days per year, in order to organize workers. Businesses are supposed to be notified before organizers arrive, and organizers are supposed to come during nonwork times such as lunch and before and after work. Judges also ruled in favor of a California man who argued his rights were violated when police pursued him into his garage after allegedly playing loud music driving down a two-lane highway at night, according to NPR. Today on AirTalk, we’re hearing more about the Supreme Court decisions and what the implications of them could be. Questions? Give us a call at 866-893-5722.

      <itunes:title>Checking In On Tokyo Olympics, Plus What We Know About LA 2028</itunes:title>
      <description>A sharply limited number of fans will be allowed to attend the Tokyo Olympics, organizers announced Monday as they tried to save some of the spirit of the Games where even cheering has been banned.

Organizers set a limit of 50% capacity — up to a maximum of 10,000 fans, all of whom must be Japanese residents — for each Olympic venue, regardless of whether it is indoors or outdoors. Officials said that if coronavirus cases rise again the rules could be changed and fans could still be barred all together. Spectators from abroad were banned several months ago, and now some local fans who have tickets will be forced to give them up.

Meanwhile, Los Angeles is already starting to think about its plan for the city ahead of the 2028 Olympics. We check in on the latest.

      <itunes:title>Construction Commences On $898 Million Station Connecting Metro Lines To LAX</itunes:title>
      <description>Construction has officially begun on LAX's long-awaited Airport Metro Connector Project, which connects Los Angeles International Airport with the Metro system. 

On Monday, the Metro held a groundbreaking ceremony commencing construction of the $898.6 million project. The Airport Metro Connector Project is slated to be completed by 2024 and will include a bus plaza, a bicycle hub and a private-vehicle drop-off zone. That station will be linked to the under-construction Metro Crenshaw/LAX line via the airport's Automated People Mover. 

The People Mover system, which is expected to be operating by 2023, will span 2.2 miles and connect directly with LAX's terminals. Today on AirTalk, we get more details on the construction of this near $900 million project. 

A representative from LAWA was originally set to join us, but they pulled out this morning.

      <itunes:title>LGBTQ Listeners Share Their Experiences Competing In Organized Sports</itunes:title>
      <description>Las Vegas Raiders defensive end Carl Nassib on Monday became the first active NFL player to come out as gay.

Nassib, who is entering his sixth NFL season and second with the Raiders, announced the news on Instagram, saying he wasn’t doing it for the attention but because he felt representation and visibility were important.

“I just wanted to take a quick moment to say that I’m gay,” Nassib said in his video message from his home in West Chester, Pennsylvania. “I’ve been meaning to do this for a while now, but I finally feel comfortable enough to get it off my chest.

“I really have the best life. I got the best family, friends and job a guy can ask for. I’m a pretty private person, so I hope you guys know that I’m really not doing this for attention. I just think that representation and visibility are so important.”
Nassib added in a written message that followed the video that he “agonized over this moment for the last 15 years” and only recently decided to go public with his sexuality after receiving the support of family and friends.

Today on AirTalk, we want to hear from LGBTQ listeners about their experiences, positive or negative, playing organized sports. Join our live conversation by calling us at 866-893-5722.

Love, loss, place and loneliness, all themes of the album that resonate deeply and profoundly. Mitchell in the past has described making the album as bleeding the songs onto the pages. In honor of the anniversary, the artist’s label has also released “Blue 50,” which features previously unreleased recordings from the album. Today on AirTalk, we discuss the importance of the album on its 50th anniversary, how it evolved overtime and its connection to Los Angeles and California. What does “Blue” mean to you? Share your thoughts on the AirTalk Facebook page or Twitter or give us a call at 866-893-5722. 

NPR is hosting a listening party to commemorate the 50th anniversary of “Blue.” Singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile joins NPR music critic Ann Powers coming right up at 11 am Pacific Time. You can watch that conversation on YouTube.

NPR's Ann Powers wrote a piece celebrating the 50th anniversary of "Blue" and looking at her connection to Miles Davis. You can read that here.

      <title>New Yorkers Will Be Using Ranked Choice Voting In Today’s Mayoral Primary -- We Explain What It Is</title>
      <itunes:title>New Yorkers Will Be Using Ranked Choice Voting In Today’s Mayoral Primary -- We Explain What It Is</itunes:title>
      <description>Ranked choice voting makes its debut in New York City's mayoral primary Tuesday in one of the most high-profile tests yet for a system  gaining use in pockets across the U.S.

The system is based on a simple premise: Democracy works better if people aren't forced to make an all-or-nothing choice with their vote. Rather than pick just one candidate, voters get to rank several in order of preference. Even if a voter's top choice doesn't have enough support to win, their rankings of other candidates still play a role in determining the victor. But the system is more complex than a traditional election, making it tough to forecast a winner. It could take longer to get results. But the system is tough to grasp. It requires voters to do a lot more research. It also makes races less predictable. Transparency and trust are also potential problems. 

In New York City's version, voters get to rank up to five candidates, from first to last, on their ballot. If one candidate is the first choice of a majority of voters - more than 50% - that person wins the race outright, just like in a traditional election. If nobody hits that threshold, ranked choice analysis kicks in. Vote tabulation is done in rounds, and all rounds of counting are done by computer in a process that takes very little time. In each round, the candidate in last place is eliminated. Votes cast ranking that candidate first are then redistributed to those voters' second choices. That process repeats until there are only two candidates left. 

Today on AirTalk, we’ll get a preview of what’s at stake in today’s primary and find out more about how ranked choice voting works.

      <title>Are Wedding Bells Back And Louder Than Ever: How Increased Demand Is Impacting The Service Vendors And Couples Looking To Say ‘I Do’</title>
      <itunes:title>Are Wedding Bells Back And Louder Than Ever: How Increased Demand Is Impacting The Service Vendors And Couples Looking To Say ‘I Do’</itunes:title>
      <description>Couples in the U.S. are racing to the altar in a vaccination-era wedding boom that has venues and other vendors in high demand.

With restrictions on large gatherings loosening, wedding planners and others who make the magic happen said they’ve started pushing their bookings into late 2022 and early 2023. Also contributing to the rush are couples who went ahead and got hitched during stricter pandemic times with few or no guests and are now on their second go-arounds with larger groups. They’re competing for services with those who had always intended to marry this year. Today on AirTalk, we discuss the implications for those who work in the wedding industry and are trying to keep up. We want to hear from you? Do you service events and weddings in some capacity? Florist? Photographer? Caterer? Call us and tell us how you’re being impacted. Also, if you’re planning to get married, is the demand having any impact on your big day? Tell us your experience by calling 866-893-5722.

With restrictions on large gatherings loosening, wedding planners and others who make the magic happen said they’ve started pushing their bookings into late 2022 and early 2023. Also contributing to the rush are couples who went ahead and got hitched during stricter pandemic times with few or no guests and are now on their second go-arounds with larger groups. They’re competing for services with those who had always intended to marry this year. Today on AirTalk, we discuss the implications for those who work in the wedding industry and are trying to keep up. We want to hear from you? Do you service events and weddings in some capacity? Florist? Photographer? Caterer? Call us and tell us how you’re being impacted. Also, if you’re planning to get married, is the demand having any impact on your big day? Tell us your experience by calling 866-893-5722.

      <itunes:title>Latest on California’s Power Grid As State Recovers From Its First Heat Wave Of The Summer</itunes:title>
      <description>Last week, Californians felt the test of heat as the first heatwave of the summer enveloped over various countries. However, the rising temperatures haven't subsided just yet. On Thursday, California issued a state of emergency due to the excessive heat. 

The California ISO, which operates 80% of the state's electric grid, sent flex alerts over the past few days to encourage residents to conserve energy resources.

With this hot heat comes high demand for power. The worry is that Californians could cause a repeat of last August, where residents endured 2 nights of rolling blackouts. So how will California prepare for this hot summer season?

Today on AirTalk, we dive into how California's energy sources will prepare for the rising temperatures.

      <title>Supreme Court Rules Against NCAA, Sides With Ex-Athletes In Compensation Case</title>
      <itunes:title>Supreme Court Rules Against NCAA, Sides With Ex-Athletes In Compensation Case</itunes:title>
      <description>The Supreme Court decided unanimously Monday that the NCAA can’t enforce rules limiting education-related benefits — like computers and paid internships — that colleges offer to student athletes.

The case doesn’t decide whether students can be paid salaries. Instead, the ruling will help determine whether schools decide to offer athletes tens of thousands of dollars in those benefits for things including tutoring, study abroad programs and graduate scholarships.

The high court agreed with a group of former college athletes that NCAA limits on the education-related benefits that colleges can offer athletes who play Division I basketball and football are unenforceable.

Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the court that the NCAA sought “immunity from the normal operation of the antitrust laws,” which the court declined to grant.

Under current NCAA rules, students cannot be paid, and the scholarship money colleges can offer is capped at the cost of attending the school. The NCAA had defended its rules as necessary to preserve the amateur nature of college sports.

But the former athletes who brought the case, including former West Virginia football player Shawne Alston, argued that the NCAA’s rules on education-related compensation were unfair and violate federal antitrust law designed to promote competition. The Supreme Court upheld a lower court ruling barring the NCAA from enforcing those rules.

As a result of the ruling, the NCAA itself can’t bar schools from sweetening their offers to Division I basketball and football players with additional education-related benefits. But individual athletic conferences can still set limits if they choose. A lawyer for the former athletes had said before the ruling that he believed that if his clients won, “very many schools” would ultimately offer additional benefits.

Today on AirTalk, we learn more about the ruling and the consequences for NCAA athletes. Questions? Give us a call at 866-893-5722.

      <title>“In The Heights” &amp; The Limits Of Latinx Representation In The Entertainment Industry</title>
      <itunes:title>“In The Heights” &amp; The Limits Of Latinx Representation In The Entertainment Industry</itunes:title>
      <description>Last week saw the release for the film “In The Heights,” a film that was hailed by many as a means to showcase the Latinx experience in Washington Heights, as well as represent the diversity found in that specific community. 

This all came to a head during an interview conducted by Afro-Cuban journalist Felice Leon, who had noted to “In The Heights” director John M. Chu that there was a lack of Afro-Latinx leading actors in the film. Following this, talks of Latinx representation became a larger conversation of Afro-Latinx erasure and white-washing of the whole community by the entertainment industry.

Today on AirTalk, we discuss the controversy surrounding “In The Heights” and how it ties in with Latinx representation in the entertainment industry. Join the conversation, call us at 866-893-5722.

      <description>Last November, Los Angeles County voters passed Measure J, which required the county to set aside 10 percent of unrestricted county funds to social justice and diversion programs. But a proposed ruling from Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mary Strobel calls the measure unconstitutional in the way that it restricts county executives from The Los Angeles Times reports the official ruling is expected in the coming weeks.

Today on AirTalk, we’ll look at some of the legal underpinnings of the ruling, and what it could mean for the county if the ruling is upheld.

      <itunes:summary>Last November, Los Angeles County voters passed Measure J, which required the county to set aside 10 percent of unrestricted county funds to social justice and diversion programs. But a proposed ruling from Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Mary Strobel calls the measure unconstitutional in the way that it restricts county executives from The Los Angeles Times reports the official ruling is expected in the coming weeks.

Today on AirTalk, we’ll look at some of the legal underpinnings of the ruling, and what it could mean for the county if the ruling is upheld.

      <title>LA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva Is Taking A Personal Interest In Addressing Unhoused People In Venice Beach</title>
      <itunes:title>LA County Sheriff Alex Villanueva Is Taking A Personal Interest In Addressing Unhoused People In Venice Beach</itunes:title>
      <description>When L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva arrived in Venice earlier this month in a cowboy hat promising to clear its famous boardwalk of homeless people, he seemed to surprise just about everybody. After all, Venice is the LAPD’s jurisdiction. Chief Michel Moore was among those caught off guard.

“I did not invite the sheriff into Venice Beach,” Moore told our newsroom. So he called his counterpart the day after his visit. “I asked him, ‘How can we work together? I want to talk to you as chief-to-sheriff.’”

Moore did not condemn Villanueva. After all, the sheriff has the authority to enforce laws anywhere in the county. And in Venice, he is able to do what Moore cannot. As COVID-19 hit last year, the city council imposed a moratorium on the removal of tents housing homeless people during daytime hours. The idea was to limit the spread of the virus. That’s meant the LAPD has had a hands-off approach to encampments across the city. (The clearing of tents at Echo Park Lake was conducted ostensibly to conduct renovations to the area.) Moore thinks the city council should lift the moratorium now that the pandemic is waning, but so far the council has kept it in place.

Today on AirTalk, we’ll talk with KPCC/LAist reporter Frank Stoltze about what he’s been able to find out about what the Sheriff hopes to accomplish.

      <itunes:title>‘Ding Dong, Avon Calling’ How Avon’s Success Started With Selling Perfumes Door-To-Door</itunes:title>
      <description>If you hear your doorbell rung today, oftentimes you'd expect to see a package or bags of food at your doorstep. But just a few decades ago, one would expect to see a woman and her bag of perfume samples.

Enter: the Avon lady, and of course the company's earworm jingle. Experiencing much success in the years following World War II, Avon often relied on recruiting salespeople to go door-to-door to sell cosmetic products. 

Author Katina Manko chronicles the history of the salespeople who built and sustained the iconic Avon company in her new book "Ding Dong, Avon Calling! The Women and Men of Avon Products, Incorporated."

Today on AirTalk, we learn the history of Avon cosmetics and how its door-to-door marketing approach stayed in the American consciousness for many years. Were you an Avon lady and want to weigh in on the conversation? Call us at (866) 893-5722.

      <title>The History, Evolution And Celebration Of Juneteenth</title>
      <itunes:title>The History, Evolution And Celebration Of Juneteenth</itunes:title>
      <description>This Saturday is Juneteenth, an annual celebration which marks the emancipation of those who had been enslaved in the United States. 

Even though President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation officially outlawed slavery in 1862, this didn’t become a reality nationally until  June 19, 1865. That’s when Union troops took over Texas and freed the remaining slaves who had been denied freedom. 

And earlier this week Congress passed a bill to make Juneteenth a federal holiday, which is now on Biden’s desk and expected to be signed this afternoon. We dive into the history, origins and evolution of Juneteenth.

      <title>Setting The Table For Today’s CalOSHA Vote On Workplace Masking Guidelines</title>
      <itunes:title>Setting The Table For Today’s CalOSHA Vote On Workplace Masking Guidelines</itunes:title>
      <description>This week, California’s economy reopened, and with it, the state dropped most mask requirements - but not all. Masks are still required for workers while they’re at work. Thursday, California’s workplace regulatory board - Cal OSHA - meets to vote on a proposal that would change coronavirus protocols in the workplace. Fully vaccinated workers could stop wearing masks and practicing physical distancing requirements. Today on AirTalk, we speak with KPCC health reporter Jackie Fortier about what the proposed rules say - and don’t say - and break down the confusion over masking in the workplace.

      <title>Breaking Down The Controversy And History Of Central American Migration To The US</title>
      <itunes:title>Breaking Down The Controversy And History Of Central American Migration To The US</itunes:title>
      <description>Last week, following a meeting with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei, Vice President Kamala Harris spoke at a news conference where she sent a message to those who wish to cross the border from Mexico to the United States: “Do not come.”

This comes after president Biden had sent an immigration bill to Congress that had mentioned its willingness to address the “root causes of migration.” With these two comments having competing interests in the eyes of many critics, it did call into question how the Biden administration plans to approach its relationships with Latin American countries, particularly Central American ones such as Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

Today on AirTalk, we break down the relationship Central American countries have had with the United States in the past and why this has affected immigration throughout the region.

      <title>Rep. Adam Schiff Responds To Trump-Era Department Of Justice Data Probe</title>
      <itunes:title>Rep. Adam Schiff Responds To Trump-Era Department Of Justice Data Probe</itunes:title>
      <description>Last week, reports emerged that the Justice Department under former President Donald Trump seized data from the accounts of at least two members of the House Intelligence Committee in 2018 as part of an aggressive crackdown on leaks related to the Russia investigation and other national security matters, according to a committee official and two people familiar with the investigation.

Prosecutors from Trump’s Justice Department subpoenaed Apple for the data, according to the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss the secret seizures first reported by The New York Times.

The records of at least twelve people connected to the intelligence panel were eventually shared, including Chairman Adam Schiff, who was then the top Democrat on the committee. California Rep. Eric Swalwell was the second member, according to spokeswoman Natalie Edelstein. The records of aides, former aides and family members were also seized, including one who was a minor, according to the committee official.

Apple informed the committee last month that their records had been shared, but did not give extensive detail. The committee is aware, though, that metadata from the accounts was turned over, the official said. The records do not contain any other content from the devices, like photos, messages or emails, one of the other people said. The third person said that Apple complied with the subpoena, providing the information to the Justice Department, and did not immediately notify the members of Congress or the committee about the disclosure.

Today on AirTalk, we’re joined by Rep. Adam Schiff to hear more about the Trump-era DOJ probe. Questions? Leave them below or call 866-893-5722.

Prosecutors from Trump’s Justice Department subpoenaed Apple for the data, according to the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss the secret seizures first reported by The New York Times.

      <title>Los Angeles Is Home to Numerous LGBTQ Landmarks. What Are The Ones Most Important To You</title>
      <itunes:title>Los Angeles Is Home to Numerous LGBTQ Landmarks. What Are The Ones Most Important To You</itunes:title>
      <description>When many people think about LGBTQ history in the United States, they cast their minds to New York City, where the history and mythologies around Stonewall and activist groups like ACT UP loom large.

But Los Angeles has long been a hotbed for queer resistance and activism as well. A decade before Stonewall, gay and trans people warded off a police raid of a downtown LA donut shop by flinging donuts and coffee cups at the officers trying to detain them, prompting the officers to flee and return with reinforcements. In central LA, Jewel’s Catch One operated for decades as a hub for the city’s Black LGBTQ community. Meanwhile, at the Reverend Troy Perry’s former home in Huntington Park, the reverend founded an LGBTQ church that officiated what Time Magazine dubbed the first public gay wedding in the country in 1968. Los Angeles’ queer history is colorful and diverse, but records are difficult to keep and local archives still struggle to make a record of the people who have long made up the community.

Today on AirTalk, we’re hearing more about some of Los Angeles’ most significant LGBTQ landmarks and histories. Do you have a favorite site of LGBTQ history or community in LA? We want to hear from you! Give us a call at 866-893-5722.

      <title>Could Importing Seawater Save The Salton Sea We Discuss The Implications</title>
      <itunes:title>Could Importing Seawater Save The Salton Sea We Discuss The Implications</itunes:title>
      <description>Salton Sea water levels continue to go down and that poses a number of problems for nearby communities and the organisms living in the water. A number of proposals being considered are focusing on the idea of importing seawater across the state’s desert to solve the problem. 

Environment reporter Mark Odalde’s new piece looks at the proposed plans. The California Natural Resources Agency is tasked with coming with a long-term fix, but the deadline is approaching. Odalde says the agency owes the state a plan by the end of 2022. 

Today on AirTalk, we break down what’s happening with the Salton Sea, the proposals being considered and the various implications. Do you have questions? Join the conversation by calling 866-893-5722.  

We reached out to the California Natural Resources Agency, but the agency was unable to make someone available for an interview.

Mark Olalde, environment reporter for ProPublica’s Southwest office, his piece is “Clock is ticking on dreams of saving Salton Sea with water from Mexico's Sea of Cortez;” he tweets @MarkOlalde

      <title>Buy Nothing: The Hyper Local Gifting Project That Took Off On Facebook</title>
      <itunes:title>Buy Nothing: The Hyper Local Gifting Project That Took Off On Facebook</itunes:title>
      <description>If you’re on Facebook, then you might be familiar with Buy Nothing groups. 

These are hyper local groups where neighbors can give away goods or services for free. And you’ll see all sorts of things on there: bikes, dog walking offers, used lamps and desks and even half-eaten cakes. The Buy Nothing Project was started in 2013 by two women from Washington state, and according to their site, they now have groups in forty-four different countries. And the founders have said that the movement isn’t just about recycling, it’s also a way to tighten communities and establish a gifting economy. We dive into the Buy Nothing Project, as well as its evolution and impact.

      <title>SoCal Is A Peacock’s Paradise, We Explore Why That Is</title>
      <itunes:title>SoCal Is A Peacock’s Paradise, We Explore Why That Is</itunes:title>
      <description>Owning a peacock was once considered a status symbol, particularly around the turn of the twentieth century. Elias J, "Lucky" Baldwin, founder of Arcadia, imported several pairs of peafowl—known colloquially as peacocks—from India to his Santa Anita Ranchero in 1879. Since then, peafowl have roamed the streets of San Gabriel Valley and even Palos Verdes, which has resumed its bird trapping.

Most recently, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors drafted an ordinance last Tuesday prohibiting the intentional feeding of the bird. 

While peafowl may be a sight to see in all its colorful plumage, some folks are not happy about the birds showing up in neighborhoods. The increase in sightings may be due to a virulent Newcastle disease that has caused them to quarantine in residential areas, the Washington Post reports. Furthermore, efforts to relocate the birds have been delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Today on AirTalk, we discuss the history of the peafowl in Southern California and explore why the area is so ideal for the birds to settle in. Are these colorfully feathered birds a pretty sight for the eye or more of an eyesore in your community? Give us a call at (866) 893-5722.

      <title>As Workplaces Consider Hybrid Return To Work, What Will That Mean For Surrounding Businesses That Rely On Employee Traffic</title>
      <itunes:title>As Workplaces Consider Hybrid Return To Work, What Will That Mean For Surrounding Businesses That Rely On Employee Traffic</itunes:title>
      <description>We’ve talked a lot on AirTalk about how companies and employees are planning their returns to working in the office. Many employers are exploring the possibility of allowing workers to continue to work on a hybrid schedule where they’d come to the office on some days and work from home on others. But as these companies and workers grapple with that issue, the businesses that are inside of or surrounding those office buildings and business parks have to wrestle with a problem of their own -- fewer people working in the office means fewer customers coming through for coffee in the morning, lunch in the afternoon, or services on the way home from work. 

So, how have these businesses survived through the pandemic when most everyone is working from home, and what do they plan to do if the employees they usually service aren’t coming back to the office?

KPCC &amp; LAist business and economy reporter David Wagner has been talking to local business owners that rely heavily on office worker traffic, and he joins us today on AirTalk to share what he’s found.

      <title>For Some Teens, Summer Jobs Are Back— But Not Everywhere</title>
      <itunes:title>For Some Teens, Summer Jobs Are Back— But Not Everywhere</itunes:title>
      <description>Working at an ice cream shop, a movie theater concession stand, up in a lifeguard tower— for many young people, seasonal work is a reality of an American summer.

Summer jobs are a way young people save money for school, help their families out financially, or just make some extra cash to fund their summer plans. On the flip side, some employers rely on seasonal labor to help staff their businesses. Last summer, lockdowns and layoffs largely kept teenagers away from summer jobs, especially in retail and hospitality. But with vaccines now available to young people and record low COVID-19 rates in many parts of the country, seasonal jobs are coming back— at least partially. While jobs in retail and hospitality are quickly expanding once again, young people interested in white-collar and research-oriented positions are finding that competition for those jobs is fiercer than ever, making professional development tough. 

Today on AirTalk, we’re learning more about the status of summer work for young people. Are you looking for summer work, or the parent of a teen who is? We want to hear about your experience! Give us a call at 866-893-5722.

      <title>What We’re Learning About Sexual Harassment Allegations Against Top Mayoral Aide</title>
      <itunes:title>What We’re Learning About Sexual Harassment Allegations Against Top Mayoral Aide</itunes:title>
      <description>The attorney for two witnesses in a sexual harassment lawsuit against the city says her clients’ testimony backs up allegations of inappropriate conduct by a longtime advisor to L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti. KPCC/LAist senior politics reporter broke the story on Tuesday afternoon. “My clients are whistleblowers… who saw time and time again that the allegations in the lawsuit were accurate in the sense that they witnessed sexual harassment, groping and other inappropriate sexually-based misconduct in the workplace,” said Micha Star Liberty, who represents two former Mayor’s office employees deposed in the lawsuit. “They also saw retaliation and intimidation when people wanted to come forward and complain,” Liberty added. KPCC/LAist agreed to withhold the names of her clients until their testimony is unsealed by the court.

LAPD officer Matthew Garza sued the city last July, saying Garcetti’s former deputy chief of staff, Rick Jacobs, routinely forced unwanted touching by hugging, grabbing his biceps, and massaging his shoulders — and subjected him to crude jokes and explicit descriptions of sexual topics. Garza says Jacobs’ behavior was often in the presence of the Mayor, who allegedly did nothing to stop the harassment.

Today on AirTalk, we’ll talk to Libby about her reporting.

      <itunes:summary>The attorney for two witnesses in a sexual harassment lawsuit against the city says her clients’ testimony backs up allegations of inappropriate conduct by a longtime advisor to L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti. KPCC/LAist senior politics reporter broke the story on Tuesday afternoon. “My clients are whistleblowers… who saw time and time again that the allegations in the lawsuit were accurate in the sense that they witnessed sexual harassment, groping and other inappropriate sexually-based misconduct in the workplace,” said Micha Star Liberty, who represents two former Mayor’s office employees deposed in the lawsuit. “They also saw retaliation and intimidation when people wanted to come forward and complain,” Liberty added. KPCC/LAist agreed to withhold the names of her clients until their testimony is unsealed by the court.

      <description>While we've been fortunate to hear many stories of the resilience of businesses through the pandemic, sadly others have not been so lucky. From restaurants to gyms to movie theaters to retail shops and beyond, you'd be hard pressed to find someone who can't tell you one place they loved that had to close during the pandemic. In a recent photo essay for the nonprofit publication Capital &amp; Main, Los Angeles based photographer Ted Soqui went out to capture some of the places in Southern California that fell victim to the coronavirus pandemic.

      <itunes:title>Teachers, Students Reflect On A Pandemic School Year</itunes:title>
      <description>After a year of zoom, distancing and uncertainty, school is out for many teachers and students in Southern California. 

Some teachers taught virtually in their living rooms, while others taught kids in person, wearing masks and spaced apart - but regardless of the specific circumstances, it was a novel year for all. We reflect on the school year, its hardships and takeaways. And if you’re a student or teacher, we want to hear from you. Call us at 866-893-5722.

      <description>While most of you probably know KPCC by the voices you hear on air every day, our station requires the contributions of so many talented, unique individuals whose names aren’t said at the end of a news story or even in the production credits at the end of the week. These are the people who truly make KPCC -- who keep our broadcast equipment running, who put on our pledge drives and help secure sponsorships and major donations, who put together the pre-recorded spots you hear between shows, who make sure that our facilities at the Mohn Broadcast Center are operating smoothly

This week on AirTalk, we’re highlighting some of these amazing people who work at KPCC who might not be as familiar with but whose tireless efforts are critical to what you hear on the air every day. Today, we’re featuring Facilities Manager Yolanda Ware, who makes sure that our office building and all its infrastructure are running like a well oiled machine, and Talent Acquisition Manager Cello Sawyer, who works with all KPCC departments in helping to identify and interview potential job candidates.

Yolanda Ware, KPCC facilities manager

      <title>One Study Explores Relationship Between Pupil Size And Attention, Reasoning And Memory</title>
      <itunes:title>One Study Explores Relationship Between Pupil Size And Attention, Reasoning And Memory</itunes:title>
      <description>Could the size of one’s pupils be an indicator of cognitive ability?

A newly-published study in the peer reviewed journal Cognition suggests there may indeed be a correlation between pupil size and higher scores on tests that measure cognitive abilities. The authors measured the size of the pupils of over 500 study participants with a high powered camera and computer that can measure how light reflects off the pupil and cornea. Then, they had the participants work through a series of tests that looked at things like memory capacity, “fluid intelligence,” which they define as the capacity to reason through new problems and attention control during distractions. The researchers report finding higher scores in fluid intelligence and attention control, and to a lesser degree memory capacity, among people with larger pupils, findings they argue tell us have some fascinating implications for what we know about the relationship between our eyes and the brain.

Today on AirTalk, we’ll talk more with the lead author of this new study about how they set up their experiment, what they found as they analyzed the data they collected and what it all tells us.
