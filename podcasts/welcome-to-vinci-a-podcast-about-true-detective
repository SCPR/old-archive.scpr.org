    <description>HBO’s True Detective is a drama steeped in crime and mystery, but it’s also a show that made the Louisiana bayou a character as unforgettable as Rust Cohle or Marty Hart. The show comes to California for its second season and stars Colin Farrell and Vince Vaughn. In this podcast, the journalists of Southern California Public Radio tell you what real-life stories in and around Los Angeles inspired creator Nic Pizzolatto as he wrote the script for the new season. Go behind the scenes of the locations featured and get hints about what’s to come.</description>
